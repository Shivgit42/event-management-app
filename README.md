# Event Management System

Event Management System is a full-stack application designed to organize, schedule, and manage events efficiently across multiple user profiles. It supports timezone-aware scheduling, history tracking for event updates, and profile-based filtering. Optimized with modern frontend patterns and data structures, it delivers fast performance with Zustand state management, React hooks, and API integration. The backend follows a modular architecture using Node.js and Express with MongoDB for persistent storage.

## ðŸ”§ Optimizations & DSA Strategies Used

| Strategy                         | Purpose                                          |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Debouncing                       | Reduces unnecessary function calls during typing |
| Memoization (`useMemo`)          | Avoids recalculating filtered/sorted data        |
| Hash Maps                        | Fast access to profiles and events (O(1) lookup) |
| Sets                             | Prevents duplicate profile assignments           |
| Caching with Zustand             | Optimized global state + avoids prop drilling    |
| Efficient Array Methods          | Immutable updates using map/filter/reduce        |
| `useCallback`                    | Prevents re-render loops in child components     |
| Async Task Queue Logic           | Handles sequential CRUD operations cleanly       |
| Early Returns & Short-Circuiting | Prevents deep nested if-else logic               |
